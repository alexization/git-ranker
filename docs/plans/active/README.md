# Active Plans

Store in-progress execution plans here.

## Naming
- `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md`

## Rules
1. Create from `docs/plans/TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Update `Progress` and `Decision Log` during implementation.
3. Link active plan in the PR body.
4. Practical mode only: move plan to `docs/plans/completed/` in the same PR before final merge.
